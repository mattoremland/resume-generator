    "notes": "Reports to VP, AI Platform within Chief Technology and AI Office (CTAIO). Fully remote role. Focus on enterprise-wide AI platform strategy and execution, leading team of cloud/ML/AI/data architects and engineers. Requires 10+ years software dev with data engineering/AI/ML focus PLUS 5+ years leadership in AI platforms. Major gaps: software architecture/engineering background (I'm data scientist not software architect), no 5+ years dedicated AI platform leadership, no enterprise self-service platform building experience. Strengths: PhD, life sciences domain, some cloud platforms, team leadership, regulatory compliance. This is a significant reach - role is more software engineering/architecture than data science leadership."

      "Throughout my career at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Gilead Sciences, and Redica Systems, I have architected and delivered enterprise data and AI platforms that accelerate research, enhance product development, and drive operational excellence. At Gilead, I defined and executed the strategic roadmap for Medical Affairs' enterprise analytics platform, architecting a centralized data lake that served as single source of truth and enabled self-service analytics across commercial and medical functions. At Takeda, I led digital and data science platforms supporting manufacturing and quality operations, architecting predictive ML systems that ran in production while serving as Spotfire platform administrator responsible for integrations, governance, and compliance. At Redica Systems, I have designed scalable multi-tenant data architectures in Snowflake and deployed production LLM systems with comprehensive governance, quality, and security controls by design. My experience spans cloud platforms including AWS, Azure Databricks, and Snowflake, and I have extensive experience integrating data services and building high-performance infrastructure for AI/ML workloads.",
      "I have a proven track record building and mentoring high-performing technical teams.

At Takeda, I managed teams of data scientists, engineers, and statistical analysts across digital and data science functions, driving adoption of advanced ML methodologies and establishing best practices. I excel at building consensus and influencing stakeholders at all levels\u2014I have collaborated with R&D, quality, manufacturing, regulatory, and commercial teams across matrixed pharmaceutical and biotech organizations, and I have presented technical solutions to senior leadership and cross-functional audiences at industry conferences. My experience working in industries governed by rigorous regulatory standards (FDA, 21 CFR Part 11, GxP) and implementing comprehensive data governance frameworks positions me well to ensure Danaher's AI platform meets compliance requirements while enabling innovation.",
      "My life sciences background\u2014including roles at three major pharmaceutical/biotech companies (Regeneron, Takeda, Gilead) plus consulting work supporting Eli Lilly and Merck\u2014provides deep domain expertise in partnering with R&D, quality, clinical, manufacturing, and commercial teams to deliver AI-driven solutions that create value. I have designed platforms that accelerate new product development (automated feed optimization at Regeneron), enhance existing products and processes (quality prediction models at Takeda), and enable data scientists to self-serve (built analytics sandboxes at Gilead and Takeda). I am passionate about staying ahead of the curve on emerging AI/ML technologies\u2014I have deployed LLM systems in production, built RAG architectures, and actively evaluate cutting-edge approaches to maintain competitive technical capabilities. I would be excited to bring this combination of technical platform expertise, team leadership, life sciences domain knowledge, and strategic vision to help Danaher build world-class AI infrastructure that transforms how your operating companies innovate and serve customers globally."
