With a PhD in Mathematics and over a decade of hands-on experience building and deploying predictive models across life sciences and technology, I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to your team.",

      "Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered end-to-end ML solutions — from designing the data architecture and engineering features through to production deployment and ongoing maintenance. At Paradigm, I built a random forest model from scratch that now runs nightly in production, grouping customer quotes into projects using custom text similarity and numerical features. At Redica, I designed a reference data architecture harmonizing data across multiple pharmaceutical clients and built a full suite of risk models implemented in Sigma. These projects required not only strong technical depth but also close collaboration with stakeholders at every level.",
      "I am particularly drawn to Test Company's mission and the opportunity to work at the intersection of advanced analytics and real business impact. My background spans both the hands-on modeling work and the strategic side — I have led teams, partnered with senior leadership, and presented at industry conferences — and I am equally comfortable in either mode depending on what the role demands."
