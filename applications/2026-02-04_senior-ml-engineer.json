With 9+ years building production ML systems, agentic AI solutions, and data-intensive applications, I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute hands-on technical expertise to an ambitious initiative.",
    "body": [
      "My background combines strong software engineering fundamentals with deep ML expertise. Recent projects demonstrate this blend: I built a production RAG system using HuggingFace and PyTorch for tax filing recommendations, deployed a random forest model to Databricks for nightly batch processing at a building supply SaaS company, and developed a production LLM classifier using the OpenAI API that processes FDA regulatory documents. I also built a full-stack puzzle game from scratch using Python, React, Node.js, and Supabase - handling everything from algorithm design to authentication to data persistence.",
      "Throughout my career in pharmaceutical manufacturing and SaaS, I've focused on building systems that work reliably in production. At Regeneron, I built automated optimization algorithms that changed business decisions for production planning. At Gilead, I architected data lakes consolidating multiple sources with automated ETL pipelines and data quality validation. At Takeda, I deployed ML models driving real-time manufacturing quality decisions. These weren't research projects - they were production systems running 24/7 with monitoring, error handling, and performance requirements.",
      "I'm based in Saratoga Springs, NY (3 hours from NYC) and hold US citizenship. I'm particularly drawn to transformational projects that require both technical depth and hands-on execution. My PhD in Mathematics gives me strong foundations in optimization and algorithms, while my industry experience has taught me how to ship production systems that deliver business value."

    "closing": "I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in building ML-driven, data-intensive systems aligns with your team's needs. I've attached my resume and look forward to learning more about the project."
