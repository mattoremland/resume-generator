With a PhD in Mathematics and 9+ years driving AI adoption in pharmaceutical environments including Medical Affairs, I'm excited about the opportunity to lead GMAF AI initiatives and shape the Worldwide Medical Affairs AI Council program.",
    "body": [
      "My experience aligns directly with this role's requirements. At Gilead Sciences, I led data and analytics strategy for Global Medical Affairs, partnering with medical strategy teams to translate business needs into practical solutions advancing scientific engagement and evidence generation. I managed cross-functional stakeholder relationships across Medical Affairs, IT, Legal, Regulatory, and Data Science, facilitating governance reviews ensuring healthcare compliance and organizational alignment. At Redica Systems, I'm currently leading AI initiatives for pharmaceutical clients building production systems including an LLM classifier processing FDA regulatory data with comprehensive governance frameworks. I've established validation metrics, coordinated Legal and Compliance reviews, developed SOPs, and managed Council operations facilitating knowledge sharing across organizations - exactly the capabilities required for the Worldwide Medical Affairs AI Council program management.",
      "I bring solid understanding of AI applications in pharma settings combined with proven ability to deliver cross-functional programs in regulated environments. My work spans Medical Affairs analytics (HCP/HCO data platforms at Gilead), regulatory intelligence (FDA enforcement systems at Redica), and manufacturing AI (optimization models at Regeneron and Takeda). I've applied disciplined project management including timelines, budgeting, risk mitigation, and executive reporting across all roles. At Takeda, I coordinated semi-annual APQR processes managing cross-functional dependencies in a matrixed global organization. I have extensive vendor management experience including evaluation, procurement workflows, and contract coordination. My technical literacy in AI/ML includes hands-on work with LLMs (OpenAI API), agentic systems (RAG architectures), and machine learning platforms while maintaining the strategic perspective required to translate medical strategy into AI solutions.",
      "Beyond technical delivery, I excel at change management and stakeholder engagement. I've led workshops, training programs, and demonstrations driving AI understanding and adoption at Regeneron, Gilead, and through consulting engagements. I've presented at industry conferences (CHPA, ISPE) communicating AI governance and compliance frameworks to pharmaceutical audiences. My experience working across medical, regulatory, legal, IT, and data science teams has developed my ability to build consensus, resolve barriers to success, and influence senior stakeholders through excellent communication and negotiation skills. I understand how to maintain up-to-date knowledge of regulatory developments and competitor benchmarking while facilitating cross-regional collaboration that advances AI adoption."
    ],
    "closing": "I'm energized by the opportunity to shape the future of AI in Medical Affairs globally and contribute to initiatives improving patient outcomes and scientific engagement. My background combining Medical Affairs experience, AI implementation expertise, and pharmaceutical regulatory compliance positions me to drive meaningful impact as a pragmatic and solutions-oriented leader. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how I can support GMAF AI strategy and lead the Worldwide Medical Affairs AI Council program. Thank you for considering my application."
