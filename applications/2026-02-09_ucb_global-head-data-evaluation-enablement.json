    "body": [
      "Throughout my career, I have built and led high-performing data operations teams focused on quality, compliance, and enablement. At Gilead Sciences, I led a team of 5 professionals managing enterprise healthcare data operations, establishing governance frameworks and training programs that accelerated adoption across Medical Affairs. At Redica Systems, I defined data strategy for pharmaceutical regulatory intelligence, building evaluation frameworks and vendor management processes that ensured high-quality, compliant data for business impact. My PhD in quantitative methods provides a strong analytical foundation for understanding complex data structures and their applications in pharmaceutical contexts.",
      "My operations-driven approach focuses on making data discoverable, accessible, and fit-for-purpose. I have extensive experience with data onboarding and operationalization, having managed vendor relationships and contracting processes while building quality validation frameworks. At Takeda, I established enterprise data governance and led change management initiatives to maximize data value. I have driven data literacy through training programs and stakeholder communication, ensuring teams can effectively leverage data assets. My experience partnering with IT, Data Office, Legal, and Compliance teams positions me to align diverse stakeholders around data strategy.",
      "While my pharmaceutical experience has centered on manufacturing, quality systems, and Medical Affairs rather than patient-level clinical data, I am confident my data operations expertise, team leadership capabilities, and commitment to quality and compliance translate directly to this role. I am eager to build deep expertise in real-world data and apply my proven frameworks for data evaluation, enablement, and governance to improve patient outcomes at UCB."
