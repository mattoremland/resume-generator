With over a decade of experience building production ML systems in highly regulated environments, I am excited by the opportunity to lead LRN's applied AI strategy and deliver scalable solutions that create measurable business impact while maintaining the rigorous governance standards essential to compliance and ethics workflows.",
    "body": [
      "My background deploying end-to-end AI solutions directly aligns with LRN's needs. At Redica Systems, I built a production LLM classifier using the OpenAI API to analyze unstructured FDA 483 inspection reports, implementing prompt engineering, evaluation frameworks (confusion matrices, precision/recall), and deployment monitoring in collaboration with data engineering teams. Through my consulting practice, I developed a RAG system for tax compliance using HuggingFace and PyTorch, and deployed a production random forest model on Databricks for a building supply SaaS platform. These experiences demonstrate my ability to translate ambiguous business problems into tractable AI work with clear milestones and validated outcomes.",
      "My leadership experience spans managing teams of 3-7 data scientists and analysts across Gilead, Takeda, and Regeneron, where I defined technical strategies, established data governance frameworks, and delivered analytics platforms serving pharmaceutical quality and regulatory intelligence needs. I have extensive experience communicating complex AI capabilities to non-technical stakeholders, including solo presentations at CHPA and ISPE conferences on AI/ML applications in FDA-regulated industries. While my domain expertise comes from pharmaceutical manufacturing rather than B2B SaaS, the parallels are strong: both require rigorous governance, risk management, privacy controls, and the ability to build trust through responsible AI practices in highly regulated contexts.",
      "I am particularly drawn to LRN's mission of advancing ethics and compliance through technology. My experience architecting AI systems under FDA oversight has given me deep appreciation for the importance of transparency, explainability, and risk mitigation when deploying ML in environments where decisions have real consequences. I would welcome the opportunity to bring this perspective to LRN's AI strategy, helping customers navigate the responsible use of AI in their own compliance and ethics workflows."
    ],
    "closing": "I would be excited to discuss how my technical depth, leadership experience, and commitment to responsible AI can contribute to LRN's success. Thank you for considering my application."
