With a PhD in Mathematics and 9+ years driving enterprise AI transformation in complex, regulated environments, I'm energized by the opportunity to define and execute Lumen's company-wide AI strategy and unlock measurable business value across customer-facing products and internal transformation.",
    "body": [
      "My experience aligns directly with Lumen's need for both strategic vision and execution discipline. At Redica Systems, I'm defining AI strategy for a SaaS platform serving enterprise pharma clients, partnering with executive leadership to align AI roadmap with business priorities. I've driven customer-facing AI innovation building production LLM systems, established governance frameworks ensuring responsible AI deployment, and presented AI vision to board-level stakeholders at industry conferences. At Gilead, I led large-scale transformation consolidating fragmented systems into unified analytics capability, mobilizing resources across IT, engineering, product, and business teams while delivering 70% productivity improvements. These experiences demonstrate my ability to balance strategic orientation with disciplined execution across matrixed organizations.",
      "I have deep understanding of modern AI capabilities and limitations spanning LLMs, agentic systems, machine learning platforms, and optimization algorithms. My PhD research in computational AI methods, combined with 9 years deploying production AI systems, gives me technical credibility with engineering teams and the ability to translate complex AI concepts into clear business priorities for executives. I've built agentic RAG systems using HuggingFace and PyTorch, integrated OpenAI API into production workflows with responsible AI guardrails, and deployed ML models in resource-constrained environments requiring careful vendor/platform selection. At Regeneron, I pioneered AI adoption building the first automated forecasting and optimization systems - exactly the type of transformation leadership required to drive company-wide AI excellence.",
      "Beyond technical execution, I excel at cross-functional influence and executive partnership. I've served as trusted advisor to VP and SVP-level leaders on AI investment decisions at Gilead, mobilized resources across competing priorities at Takeda, and resolved execution bottlenecks in matrixed pharmaceutical organizations with complex governance requirements. I understand how to secure commitment from functional and technical leaders, establish clear pathways to execution including dependencies and sequencing, and drive value realization through disciplined metrics frameworks. My experience operating in FDA-regulated environments with strict compliance requirements translates directly to establishing AI governance that enables innovation without slowing execution. I've communicated AI vision to diverse audiences from senior executives to technical teams to industry conferences, demonstrating executive presence and the ability to mobilize stakeholders."

    "closing": "I'm inspired by Lumen's commitment to transformation through AI excellence and the opportunity to shape how AI is defined, prioritized, and scaled across the enterprise. While I recognize the role seeks 15+ years of experience, my 9 years combines deep technical AI expertise with strategic leadership, measurable business impact, and proven ability to drive transformation in complex organizations. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can accelerate Lumen's AI vision and deliver meaningful value aligned with your North Star. Thank you for considering my application."
