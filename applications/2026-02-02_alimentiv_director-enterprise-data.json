With over 10 years of experience architecting enterprise data platforms, building analytics capabilities, and driving business value from data in pharmaceutical and life sciences organizations, I am excited about the opportunity to lead Alimentiv's data architecture and business intelligence strategy.",
    "body": [
      "Throughout my career at Regeneron, Takeda, Gilead, and Redica Systems (supporting pharmaceutical clients including Eli Lilly and Merck), I have architected and implemented enterprise-grade data platforms that support structured and unstructured data across regulated operations. At Gilead, I designed and built a centralized data lake that served as the single source of truth for Medical Affairs, implementing scalable data pipelines supporting both real-time and batch processing while ensuring data integrity, security, and compliance with FDA regulatory standards. At Redica Systems, I architected multi-tenant data platforms in Snowflake that integrated regulatory intelligence, quality metrics, and operational data flows for multiple pharmaceutical clients. At Takeda, I designed data architectures supporting predictive analytics and real-time monitoring across manufacturing and quality operations. My experience spans Azure Databricks (deployed production ML systems for Paradigm), AWS, Snowflake, and enterprise data repositories designed for compliance with GxP and 21 CFR Part 11 requirements.",
      "I have consistently driven measurable business value from data by moving beyond traditional dashboards to develop predictive and prescriptive analytics. At Regeneron, my automated limit calculation models reduced manual effort by 80%, feed optimization improved yields, and quality prediction models reduced batch failures. At Redica Systems, I built risk-scoring models that enabled clients to optimize resource allocation and proactively identify compliance risks. At Takeda, I deployed AI/ML models for manufacturing forecasting and quality risk detection that improved operational efficiency. I excel at collaborating with stakeholders to identify high-impact use cases where data solves real business problems\u2014at Gilead, I extended data architecture to support Commercial, Medical Affairs, Quality, and Regulatory functions; at Takeda, I mapped end-to-end operational data flows across manufacturing and quality to uncover optimization opportunities.",
      "My leadership experience includes building and mentoring high-performing teams (managed 3-7 direct reports across roles), establishing data governance frameworks that balance agility with regulatory compliance, and communicating technical concepts effectively to executive leadership and cross-functional stakeholders. At Gilead, I managed a BI team delivering Spotfire dashboards to commercial and medical stakeholders. At Takeda, I served as Spotfire system administrator while leading digital and data science groups. I have implemented data stewardship roles, metadata management practices, and data quality standards across multiple organizations, and I have led data audits ensuring readiness for regulatory inspections. While my background is in pharmaceutical manufacturing and quality rather than CRO clinical operations, the core competencies\u2014architecting scalable data platforms, integrating data from multiple enterprise systems, implementing governance in regulated environments, deploying AI/ML in production, and driving business outcomes from data\u2014are directly applicable to Alimentiv's clinical research environment."
