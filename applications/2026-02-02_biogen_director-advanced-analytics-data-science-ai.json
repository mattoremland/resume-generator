    "notes": "US Commercial role focused on brand/TA analytics, marketing mix optimization, channel optimization, digital analytics for pharmaceutical company. Requires 10 years advanced analytics in US commercial settings (pharma/biotech or consulting). MODERATE STRETCH: My 10+ years pharma experience is in manufacturing/quality/medical affairs, NOT commercial/marketing analytics. Commercial functions (brand analytics, marketing mix, attribution, channel optimization) are outside my experience. Strengths: 10+ years pharma, ML/AI expertise, Python/R/SQL, team leadership, stakeholder influence, predictive modeling. Need to emphasize transferable analytics leadership and pharma domain while acknowledging commercial analytics gap."
