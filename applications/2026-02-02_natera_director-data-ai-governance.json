    "notes": "Enterprise-wide data and AI governance role overseeing Data Governance Council, stewardship model, and technical governance implementation. Requires 15+ years in data/AI governance with 7+ in leadership. STRETCH: I don't have 15 years focused on governance specifically. Strengths: data governance frameworks (Gilead, Redica), AI governance (LLM classifier validation), regulatory compliance (FDA, 21 CFR Part 11, GxP), technical implementation. Healthcare regulatory frameworks (HIPAA, CLIA, FDA AI guidance) are relevant but I lack deep healthcare-specific governance experience. Technical governance (embed controls in code, pipelines) aligns well with my hands-on work."

      "Throughout my career at Regeneron, Takeda, Gilead Sciences, and Redica Systems, I have built comprehensive data governance programs and AI governance frameworks that balance robust controls with practical implementation. At Gilead, I established an enterprise data governance program for Medical Affairs managing HCP/HCO healthcare reference data\u2014I defined data management strategy, implemented data quality frameworks with automated validation and testing, built enterprise data catalogs with metadata management and lineage tracking, and ensured HIPAA compliance for healthcare professional information. I chaired cross-functional governance forums with Legal, Regulatory, Quality, IT, and Medical Affairs stakeholders, led a federated stewardship model where business units owned data while governance enforced consistency, and developed vendor governance frameworks for third-party data providers. Critically, I embedded data quality checks and lineage tracking directly into data pipelines, ensuring governance guardrails were adopted without friction in engineering delivery.",

      "My healthcare regulatory experience spans FDA regulations, 21 CFR Part 11, GxP compliance in pharmaceutical manufacturing, and HIPAA compliance for healthcare reference data at Gilead. I have presented at industry conferences (CHPA, ISPE) on AI applications in FDA-regulated industries including ethical considerations and regulatory compliance requirements. I have tracked external regulatory trends and understand emerging AI regulations including NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, and FDA AI/ML guidance. While my governance experience has been primarily in pharmaceutical manufacturing and quality operations rather than dedicated governance leadership roles for 15 years, the core competencies\u2014building governance councils, implementing stewardship models, translating policies into technical controls, managing vendor AI risks, driving change management and training, and ensuring regulatory compliance\u2014are directly applicable. I have proven ability to lead cross-functional governance initiatives, influence executive stakeholders, and build cultures of responsible data and AI adoption. I would be excited to bring this combination of technical governance expertise, regulatory compliance experience, and hands-on implementation capability to establish enterprise-wide data and AI governance programs at your organization."
