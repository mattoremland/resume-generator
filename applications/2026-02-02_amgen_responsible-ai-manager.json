With a PhD in Mathematics and over 10 years of experience developing, deploying, and governing AI/ML systems in FDA-regulated pharmaceutical and biotech environments, I am excited to contribute to Amgen's commitment to responsible AI development and use.",
    "body": [
      "Throughout my career in pharma and biotech (Regeneron, Takeda, Gilead, Redica Systems with clients including Eli Lilly and Merck), I have built and operationalized governance frameworks for AI/ML systems across their full lifecycle. At Redica Systems, I designed and deployed a production LLM classifier for FDA 483 analysis, owning the complete governance workflow from validation framework design (using confusion matrices) to documentation of model behavior, limitations, and ongoing performance monitoring. At Gilead, I established comprehensive data governance frameworks including data inventory, lineage tracking, quality standards, and audit-ready documentation that served as the foundation for responsible data and analytics operations. At Takeda, I validated and deployed predictive ML models in GMP manufacturing while serving as Spotfire system administrator, ensuring compliance with 21 CFR Part 11 and maintaining continuous oversight of system performance and data integrity.",
      "My technical fluency spans modern AI/ML platforms (OpenAI API, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, HuggingFace), enterprise data platforms (Snowflake, Databricks, AWS), and the software development lifecycle. I have hands-on experience writing SQL queries to analyze system and inventory data, and I understand how AI systems are designed, deployed, and operated in enterprise environments including platform integrations, data flows, and operational controls. Critically, I excel at translating complex governance requirements into clear, intuitive workflows and documentation\u2014at Gilead, I wrote formal data requirements that cross-functional teams could understand and apply; at Takeda, I developed SOPs that made regulatory requirements accessible to stakeholders at all levels; at Redica, I designed practical guidance for implementing AI responsibly in quality and regulatory intelligence use cases.",
      "I am particularly drawn to this role's focus on designing governance that is not only robust and auditable, but also understandable and accessible to the people who rely on it every day. As a recognized speaker on AI/ML applications in FDA-regulated industries (CHPA, ISPE conferences), I have demonstrated my ability to communicate complex technical and ethical concepts to diverse audiences. My experience collaborating with Legal, Quality, Compliance, IT, and Digital Trust teams across pharmaceutical organizations positions me well to partner cross-functionally as you integrate Responsible AI requirements into existing enterprise processes. I am excited about the opportunity to help shape how Responsible AI is experienced at Amgen\u2014rethinking process flows, designing practical guardrails, and ensuring governance provides clear visibility, traceability, and continuous oversight across your AI inventory."

    "closing": "I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience governing AI/ML systems in regulated pharmaceutical environments can support Amgen's Responsible AI framework. Thank you for considering my application."
