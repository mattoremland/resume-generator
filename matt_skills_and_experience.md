## Work History

### Redica Systems (2025–Present)
**Director, Data Strategy & Analytics** | Remote

- Pharma clients: Eli Lilly, Merck, ProQuality Network
- FDA Form 483 data platform — risk scoring, regulatory intelligence
- **LLM Classifier (OpenAI API):** Built a production model that reads unstructured FDA 483 text and assigns severity levels (low/medium/high/critical) and weighted topic categories (e.g., Quality Unit, Documentation). Owned design, prompt engineering, and validation (confusion matrices). Handed deployment to data engineering but collaborated on validation to ensure production accuracy. Model runs in production across the entire platform.
- Built risk-scoring models from scratch using Python and Snowflake
- Designed reference data architecture to harmonize multi-source client data (messy Excel matching, inferring missing values, custom join columns)
- Developed Python visualization library for brand-specific analytics output
- Client-facing: presentations at CHPA (solo panel), ISPE (co-presented with consultant), authored content for PDA Korea
- Conference presentations: CHPA Quality & Manufacturing Meeting, CHPA Regulatory/Scientific/Quality Conference, ISPE Annual Meeting, Redica webinar, PDA Korea

### Matt Oremland, LLC (2023–Present)
**Consulting Data Scientist** | Saratoga Springs, NY

- **Paradigm (building supply software):** Quote fingerprinting random forest model. Groups quotes into projects using text and numerical features. Production model, runs nightly. Worked directly with client stakeholders including VP of Product and data engineering teams.
- Delivered end-to-end modeling engagements across multiple industries
- Used Databricks extensively at Paradigm

### Gilead Sciences (2023–2024)
**Director, Data & Analytics (Medical Affairs)** | Foster City, CA

- Defined and executed enterprise data and analytics strategy; strategic advisor to senior leadership
- Built centralized data lake as single source of truth
- Built dashboards from scratch in Spotfire; managed internal Spotfire team
- Established data governance frameworks, wrote formal data requirements
- Managed vendors and internal teams
- Authored content presented at PDA Korea by Gilead colleagues

### Takeda Pharmaceuticals (2021–2022)
**Associate Director, Digital & Data Science** | Lexington, MA

- Led digital and data science group + statistical monitoring group
- Predictive modeling using ML for manufacturing and quality decisions
- Spotfire system administrator
- Led semi-annual APQR (Annual Product Quality Review) meetings
- Built digital dashboards for real-time process/quality monitoring
- Wrote data requirements; cross-functional team leadership

### Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (2016–2021)
**Senior Process Data Scientist** | Rensselaer, NY

- Predictive modeling for biopharmaceutical manufacturing: automated limit calculations, feed quantity optimization, product quality prediction
- Ensemble methods, PLS, PCA
- Built automated data pipelines (ingestion, cleaning, transformation)
- Presented to senior leadership and cross-functional stakeholders
- Promoted from Data Scientist to Senior Data Scientist (organic, ~5 years)
- Final year: moved to simulation/device optimization team but left shortly after

---

## Leadership

- Managed teams of 3–7 people (mix of full-time and contractors)
- Takeda: led digital/data science group + statistical monitoring group; led APQR meetings
- Gilead: managed Spotfire dashboard team; hiring and performance development
- Hiring and mentoring experience across multiple roles
- No manager-of-managers experience (direct reports only)

## Tools & Technologies

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| Programming | Python (advanced), SQL (AI-assisted) |
| Cloud & Data Platforms | Snowflake, Databricks, AWS (data storage), Sigma |
| ML Frameworks | Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch |
| AI / LLM | OpenAI API (production classifier) |
| Visualization & BI | Spotfire, Sigma, custom Python viz |
| Other | Pandas, data pipelines (ETL/ELT) |

### Modeling Techniques
Random Forest, PLS, PCA, Ensemble Models, LLM Classification (OpenAI), Agent-Based Modeling, Mechanistic Modeling, Symbolic Regression, Multi-Objective Optimization (genetic/evolutionary algorithms)

### Notable Gaps
- SQL is AI-assisted, not strong independently
- No Tableau, Looker, Power BI, or dbt experience
- No SAS experience
- No A/B testing or experimentation platform experience
- No healthcare claims/EHR/insurance domain experience
- No SaaS or cybersecurity domain experience
- No manager-of-managers experience
- AWS experience limited to data storage (not compute/SageMaker/Lambda)
